# ace128-rpi
Raspberry PI Python module to support the Bourns ACE128 encoder with PCF8574 I2C backpack

This replicates the functionality of the [Arduino ace128](https://github.com/arielnh56) repo on the RaspberryPI python platform.

It uses the standard libraries. 

EEPROM saving of state is replaced with file saves. This is still optional.

No support for MCP23008. If you want it, fork and contribute!
